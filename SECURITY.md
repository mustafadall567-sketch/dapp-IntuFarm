# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security policies and procedures for the StableCoin Farming dApp. This is a testnet deployment designed for testing and educational purposes.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Features

### Smart Contract Security

- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions (Admin, Pauser, Treasurer)
- **Reentrancy Protection**: All external functions protected with `nonReentrant` modifier
- **Pause Mechanism**: Emergency pause functionality for critical situations
- **Lock Period**: 7-day lock period to prevent flash loan attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs
- **Overflow Protection**: Using Solidity 0.8.24+ built-in overflow checks
- **Safe Math**: OpenZeppelin SafeERC20 for token transfers

### Architecture Security

- **Checks-Effects-Interactions**: Following CEI pattern in all functions
- **Pull over Push**: Users claim rewards rather than automatic distribution
- **Time-based Locks**: Timelock controller for critical operations
- **Emergency Controls**: Emergency withdraw with fee mechanism
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event logging for monitoring

### Frontend Security

- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Secure Headers**: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **HTTPS Only**: All connections over HTTPS
- **Wallet Security**: Integration with secure wallet providers

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Scope

We welcome security researchers to review our code and report vulnerabilities. Please focus on:

- Smart contract vulnerabilities
- Logic errors in reward calculations
- Access control bypasses
- Reentrancy attacks
- Flash loan vulnerabilities
- Frontend security issues
- Configuration errors

### Out of Scope

- DoS attacks requiring excessive gas costs
- Issues in third-party dependencies
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical access to systems
- Attacks requiring access to private keys

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@example.com] (replace with actual email)
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Triage**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 1 week
  - Medium: 2 weeks
  - Low: 1 month

### Rewards

This is a testnet deployment for educational purposes. We offer:

- Recognition in our Hall of Fame
- Detailed feedback on the report
- Collaboration on the fix
- No monetary rewards (testnet only)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Wallet Security

- Use hardware wallets when possible
- Verify all transaction details before signing
- Never share your private keys or seed phrases
- Use strong, unique passwords for wallet software
- Keep wallet software updated

### Contract Interaction

- Verify contract addresses before interacting
- Start with small amounts to test functionality
- Understand the lock period before staking
- Monitor your positions regularly
- Use the emergency withdraw only in emergencies

### General Security

- Verify you're on the correct website URL
- Use updated browsers with security patches
- Be cautious of phishing attempts
- Don't click suspicious links in emails or social media
- Always verify transaction details in your wallet

## Smart Contract Addresses

**⚠️ TESTNET ONLY - NO REAL VALUE ⚠️**

Update these addresses after deployment:

- StableUSD (sUSD): `TBD`
- Reward Token (RWD): `TBD`
- Farming Vault: `TBD`

### Verification

Always verify contract addresses through:
1. Official documentation
2. GitHub repository
3. Official social media channels
4. Block explorer

## Known Limitations

### Testnet Specific

- Centralized minting for ease of testing
- Simplified access controls
- No collateralization mechanism
- Test tokens have no real value

### General

- Smart contracts are immutable once deployed
- Emergency pause affects all users
- Lock periods cannot be bypassed (except emergency withdraw)
- Reward rates are set by administrators

## Incident Response

### Classification

- **Critical**: Funds at risk, system compromised
- **High**: Potential fund loss, major functionality affected
- **Medium**: Limited impact, workarounds available
- **Low**: Minor issues, cosmetic problems

### Response Plan

1. **Detection**: Monitor events, user reports, automated alerts
2. **Assessment**: Classify severity and impact
3. **Response**: 
   - Critical/High: Immediate pause if necessary
   - Medium/Low: Planned maintenance window
4. **Communication**: Update users via official channels
5. **Resolution**: Deploy fixes, resume operations
6. **Post-mortem**: Analyze incident, improve processes

## Security Audits

### Internal Reviews

- Code review checklist completed
- Static analysis tools run
- Unit test coverage > 95%
- Integration tests passing
- Invariant tests implemented

### External Audits

- External audit recommended before mainnet
- Bug bounty program for mainnet deployment
- Continuous security monitoring
